🎮 Hangman Game – Python 🐍
Internship Task 1 – CodeAlpha (Python Development)

Welcome to my first project as part of the internship at CodeAlpha! This is a simple, console-based Hangman Game developed using core Python concepts. It's designed to be interactive, fun, and a great way to apply basic programming logic.

📌 Project Overview
In this version of Hangman, the player has to guess a hidden word (from a list of fruits) one letter at a time. The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.

🛠️ Features
✅ A word is randomly selected from a predefined list of 5 fruit names.

✅ The player is allowed a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses.

✅ Displays progress of the word after each guess.

✅ Tracks and displays used letters to avoid repeats.

✅ Terminal-based input/output (no GUI).

🧠 Concepts Used
random.choice() to select the word

while loop for continuous gameplay

if-else conditions to check guesses

String and list manipulation

Logical thinking and flow control

📈 Learning Outcomes
Applied programming fundamentals to a real mini-project

Practiced working with user inputs and condition handling

Gained hands-on experience building a playable game using Python logic

🚀 What’s Next?
Looking forward to taking on more exciting Python projects as part of my internship at CodeAlpha. Stay tuned for Task 2!
