# sonali-kommawar-Hangman-Game-Internship-Task-1-CodeAlpha-
🎮 This is a simple text-based Hangman game built using Python 🐍 as part of my internship at CodeAlpha 💼. It involves guessing letters of a hidden word with limited attempts, using basic loops, conditions, and string handling. A fun project to apply core programming concepts! 🚀
